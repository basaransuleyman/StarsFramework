Interacting with StarFrameworkInterface
StarFrameworkInterface is an interface for adding and managing stars. Implement this interface to customize the functionality provided by the framework.

StarFrameworkInterface serves as the primary interface for adding and managing stars within your application. By implementing this interface, you can customize and extend the functionality provided by the framework to suit your specific needs.

Adding a Star
To add a star through the framework, you first instantiate your manager class that implements StarFrameworkInterface, and then call the addStarWithInterface method with the desired parameters for the star's size, color, and brightness. Here is an example:

```kotlin
class StarManager : StarFrameworkInterface {
    override fun addStarWithInterface(size: String, color: String, brightness: String) {
        // Implementation of star addition logic
    }
}

// Usage
val starManager = StarManager()
starManager.addStarWithInterface("S", "Blue", "Bright")
```
